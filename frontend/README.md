## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harunurrashid97/socialapp.git
cd socialapp/frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure the backend is running first.

## What's implemented

- Register with first name, last name, email, password
- Login / logout with JWT (access + refresh tokens in cookies)
- Auto token refresh on 401 — user stays logged in seamlessly
- Feed page is protected — redirects to login if not authenticated
- Create posts with text and optional image, choose public or private
- Posts sorted newest first
- Like / unlike posts with emoji reactions (like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry)
- Comments and replies with their own like/unlike
- Click likes count to see who liked it (modal)
- Optimistic UI updates for likes

---

## Auth Flow (short version)

1. User logs in → gets `access_token` + `refresh_token`
2. Both stored in cookies
3. Every Axios request attaches the access token as `Bearer`
4. If a request gets `401`, Axios interceptor calls `/token/refresh/` automatically
5. If refresh also fails → redirect to `/login`

---

## Pages

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | public | email + password |
| `/register` | public | first name, last name, email, password |
| `/feed` | protected | redirects to `/login` if not authenticated |
